          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Green energy refers to electricity generated from renewable and
            environmentally sustainable sources such as solar, wind, hydropower,
            geothermal, and biomass. The global shift toward renewable energy is
            driven by the need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, improve
            energy security, and support sustainable economic development. This
            report provides a concise technical overview of global green energy
            trends, technologies, and challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Renewable energy capacity has grown rapidly over the past decade.
            Solar and wind are currently the fastest-expanding sources due to
            declining costs and technological improvements. Hydropower remains
            the largest renewable electricity source globally, while solar
            photovoltaic (PV) installations account for most new capacity
            additions. Many countries have committed to net-zero emissions
            targets by 2050, accelerating investments in clean energy
            infrastructure and grid modernization.
          </p>
          <h3>Key green energy sources</h3>
          <ul type="disk">
            <li>
              Solar Energy: Converts sunlight into electricity using
              photovoltaic panels; widely adopted due to scalability and
              decreasing costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wind Energy: Uses turbines to generate electricity; major growth
              in onshore and offshore wind farms
            </li>
            <li>
              Hydropower: Produces electricity from flowing water; provides
              stable baseload power but depends on geography and water
              availability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Geothermal Energy: Utilizes underground heat; reliable but limited
              to suitable regions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Green energy development creates jobs in manufacturing,
            installation, and maintenance while reducing dependence on fossil
            fuels. Renewable power generation significantly lowers carbon
            dioxide emissions and air pollution. The levelized cost of
            electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind has declined, making
            renewables competitive with or cheaper than fossil-fuel-based
            generation in many regions.
          </p>
          <h4>Challenges experienced in that sector</h4>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>High upfront infrastructure and storage costs</li>
            <li>Intermittent power supply from solar and wind</li>
            <li>Limited grid capacity in developing regions</li>
            <li>Policy and regulatory inconsistencies</li>
            <li>Need for improved energy storage technologies</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Global renewable energy capacity is expected to continue expanding
            through 2030 and beyond. Advances in battery storage, green
            hydrogen, and smart grid systems will enhance reliability and
            efficiency. International cooperation, supportive policies, and
            sustained investment are essential to meeting climate targets and
            ensuring universal access to clean energy.
